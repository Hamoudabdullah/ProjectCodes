# ProjectCodes
These are some of the codes that i wrote during my second years project. 
Before starting working with the Ultrasonic HC-SR04. 

1. I started searching informations about this sensor. I read different scientific articles to calculate the distance between the trigger beam and the echo.
after that Me and Patricia found som code at Kjell och Company website. I compared the calculation that i read in scientific articles to make sure that the calculation is right.

Then we wrote together the rest of the codes.
2. My and Elvin thought to use Blue tooth for wireless communication. We wrote code to see how bluetooth works, but then we after a couple of days decided to use Xbee because Xbee has much benefits than bluetooth.
3. I wrote as well some codes for the Xbee transmitter and reciever.
4. I helped the other groups PD/MM to connect their Motor shield and wrote codes to start their motor.
I hade promblem to start work with GITHUB in my computer and now i am using the univercitys computer to save my codes.
