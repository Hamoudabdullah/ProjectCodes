# ProjectCodes
These are some of the codes that i wrote during my second years project. 
Before starting working with the Ultrasonic HC-SR04. 

1. I started searching informations about this sensor. I read different scientific articles to calculate the distance between the trigger beam and the echo.
after that Me and Patricia found som code at Kjell och Company website. I compared the calculation that i read in scientific articles to make sure that the calculation is right.

Then we wrote together the rest of the codes.

2. I wrote as well some codes for the Xbee transmitter and reciever.
3. I helped the other grupps PD/MM to connect their Motor shield and wrote codes to start their motor.

I hade promblem to start work with GITHUB in my computer and now i am using the univercities computer to save my codes.
